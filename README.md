# Data Structures coursework

This is the coursework done for a system programming class at the University of Washington. A chat application and a chessAI are the projects that were worked on in this class.

## Content files

The data structures folder contain structures that are used to store data in the chat application. Some of the data structures implemented are MinFourHeap and HashTrieMap. [Specification](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/18wi/assignments/projects/p1/spec1.pdf)

The Umessage folder contains files that have the backend of this chat application. It uses the data structures implemented to store data and sort them so the predictive element of the application can be implemented.

The ChessAI folder contains files that has the backend of the AI that determine the optimal to make. The algorithm is implemented with ideas from parallelism. A Jamboree and alpha-beta pruning were used for this algorithm. [Specification](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/18wi/assignments/projects/p3/spec3.pdf)
